          Hi! I’m <strong>Jessa B. Lozano</strong>. I love watching movies and K-dramas, exploring new places, 
          and trying out interesting things I recently discovered. I enjoy discovering new experiences 
          that spark my curiosity and creativity, whether it’s learning something new, appreciating a story, 
          or enjoying small adventures in everyday life. I’m always excited to explore the world around me 
          and find inspiration in the little things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about using my creativity and curiosity to bring ideas to life, 
          and I love finding simple, meaningful ways to make everyday experiences more enjoyable.
        </p>
